# 🛡️ Fraud Investigation Assistant — GenAI + RAG + HITL (Vertex AI + Streamlit)

This project is a Generative AI–powered Fraud Detection & Investigation Assistant built using **Google Vertex AI**, **Streamlit**, and **BigQuery**. It combines:
- ✅ **Gemini 1.5 Pro** for generating fraud investigation summaries
- 🔍 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** using recent transaction behavior from **BigQuery**
- 🤖 **LLM-as-a-Judge** to evaluate AI-generated summaries
- 🧑‍💼 **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** feedback interface for analysts
